### Supervised learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples
* In supervised learning, ML algorithms are given training data categorized as input variables and output variables from which to learn patterns and make inferences on previously unseen data (testing data). 
* The goal of supervised learning is for machines to replicate a mapping function we have identified for them (for example, which students passed or failed the test at the end of the semester). 
* Provided enough examples, ML algorithms can learn to recognize and respond to patterns in data without explicit instructions. 
* Supervised machine learning is typically used for 
    * Classification tasks, in which we segment the data inputs into categories (e.g., for pass/fail decisions, strongly agree/agree/neutral/disagree/strongly disagree), and 
    * Regression tasks, in which the output variable is a real value, such as a test score. The accuracy of supervised learning algorithms typically is easy to evaluate, because there is a known, “ground truth”" (output variable) to which the algorithm is optimizing (see Figure 6.7)
